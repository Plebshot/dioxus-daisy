# ðŸŒ¼ Dioxus DaisyUI Preview

This is a bare bones preview app for the Dioxus DaisyUI Component Library.
At the moment, it is an inferior carbon copy port of the [DaisyUI documentation](https://v5.daisyui.com/components/button/) to Dioxus.

## Development

### Tailwind

To keep tailwind's CSS file up to date, run the following command to install the dependencies and let tailwind watch for changes:

```bash
npm install
scripts/tailwind
```

### Running the app

To serve your app, run the following command:

```bash
scripts/web
```

Other platforms technically work too, but this project is intended for web at the moment.

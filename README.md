# ðŸŒ¼ Dioxus Daisy

A component library for Dioxus, that wraps around [daisyUI V5](https://v5.daisyui.com/).

## Status

This is currently just an experimental project and playground for me to learn more about how to create apps with Dioxus and DaisyUI.

The library itself currently only supports the `Button` and `Loading` components.

To view the components in action, check out the [Dioxus DaisyUI Preview](dioxus-daisy-preview), an inferior carbon copy of the original DaisyUI documentation website, written in Dioxus.
